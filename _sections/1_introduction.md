## Introduction

As we all know, the USA has a huge impact on the Internet, especially Forums such as Reddit. We thus wanted to visualize effectively, whether the election of 2016 had a significant impact on the different interactions observed between Trump supporters and non-supporters. We could start off by questioning if these people even acknowledged each other, and then whether or not they had positive or negative interactions. Some stereotypes can say that Trump supporters are seen as hostile or ignorant, while people interacting with them are arrogant and communists. The general consensus, at least shown by the very polarized American medias, is that both sides hate each other and that there is a real separation between supporters and others. We will, during this study, try to show if those stereotypes are true. If not, then how can we caracterize the exchanges and their evolution. Our goal is to visualize more clearly with only the interactions of users, how the Trump political landscape interacts with outsiders. Studying using such a vast a precise dataset allows us to have a better understanding with the least bias possible.
