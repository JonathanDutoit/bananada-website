## Conclusion
Initially we thought that we would see a majority of negative interactions. This bias is probably due to the mainstream media shifting two very polarized narratives, but by observing individuals we did not notice a significant amount of hate speech, at least compared to what could be expected. Individual Trump supporters share many similitudes with the random Reddit user and do not especially stand out. However what can be said and what's really important to point out, is the Growth of interactions. As Trump shifted from being a businessman to a political figure, this phenomenon happened quite quickly. This can easily be explained by his provocative behaviour sparking outrage or on the other side of the coin, fascination. How could a public figure be so blunt ? This led to both sides getting involved and Trump supporting communities seeing birth. This phenomenon is quite rare. To take a simple example, Joe Biden 46th president of the USA, has a subreddit but only 78,6k people are following it at the time we are writing this. Meanwhile r/The_Donald got banned at almost 800k because judged too problematic and r/AskTrumpSupporters (not even a main subreddit regarding Trump) has more than 100k followers. This goes to show that Trump is a major figure of American politics and managed to dissociate himself from the average politician.
